Developed an Airfield Lighting Control and Monitoring System (ALCMS) interface using Python (PySerial, Tkinter) to enable real-time data communication between USB and RS-485 networks, supporting over 50 CCR (Constant Current Regulator) connections via parallel communication.

Engineered and optimized data exchange and monitoring workflows, ensuring reliable transmission, visualization, and control of lighting system parameters across multiple hardware nodes for improved operational efficiency and system scalability.
